# Smart Object

This repository contains the design files for the BRIC: the block for robot interactions in collective tasks. The purpose of the BRIC is to allow robot swarms to interact with a responsive environment. For more detailed information, please refer to the technical report (**LINK**).

The [Mechanical Design](https://github.com/demiurge-project/smartobject-hardware/tree/master/Mechanical%20Design) directory contains the design files for the structure of the BRIC. The top and bottom sections, as well as the structure to support the accelerometer, are provided as STL files for 3D-printing purposes. The parts that compose the middle section are provided as DXF files for laser-cutting.

The [PCB Design](https://github.com/demiurge-project/smartobject-hardware/tree/master/PCB%20Design) directory contains the design files for the PCB that actuates the LEDs, interfaces the microcontroller and holds the battery. The [Gerber](https://github.com/demiurge-project/smartobject-hardware/tree/master/PCB%20Design/Gerber) directory contains the production files in Gerber format, while the [Stencil](https://github.com/demiurge-project/smartobject-hardware/tree/master/PCB%20Design/Stencil) directory contains the stencil designs.
